# About this Digital Garden
Read the [About](/about) and [Digital Garden Terms of Service](/digital-garden-tos) pages to learn about the intention behind this website and digital gardening.

# Set Up
This site runs on a subdomain of my [main website](https://chanduavni.com/). (My main website's repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ch4ndua/chanduavni-site).)

This digital garden was set up using Maxime Vaillancourt's free, open-source template [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). The template's source code is available under the [MIT license](/LICENSE). I used Maxime Vaillancourt's [tutorial for setting up a digital garden with Jekyll](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) to connect this site's GitHub repository to Netlify for deployments.

I loosely followed [Mike Tannenbaum's guide](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow) for setting up markdown files using [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd) within the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) directory for the digital garden. I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) as my IDE so I decided to utilize it for the backend. I've utilized Obsidian and VSCodium for creating and editing notes in this digital garden.
