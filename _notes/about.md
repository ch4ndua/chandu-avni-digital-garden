# About This Digital Garden
When I was setting up my [main website](https://chanduavni.com/), I knew I wanted a place to share my learnings, experiences, and thoughts.

## Is this a blog?
No. This is a digital garden. Read this [not-legally-binding “terms of service”](/digital-garden-tos) to better understand the intention of this website and how to interact with its content.

## What is a digital garden?
Digital gardens are a way to present ideas and information. The content in a digital garden differs from a blog, because the latter is organized by reverse chronology and the former is nonlinear and based on forming links between ideas. In many (but not all) cases, blog posts are intended to be perfect at the time of publication and rarely edited afterwards. Digital gardens allow for quick notes that can be revisted in the future. (Read [Maggie Appleton's "A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden"](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)for further information on digital gardens vs blogs.) 

Ideas in a digital garden grow through writing and revising in public, which lends itself to the concept of learning in public. ([Shawn Wang's "Learn In Public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) elaborates on the benefits of learning in public.)
